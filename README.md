# React Server Side Rendering

## About the app

In this app, I use webpack to build and compile my code.
Because, I have server side and client side code, and both need to be compiled,
I've splitted my webpack configuration, to two config files (webpack.server.config, webpack.client.config)
Both config files extend the base confing.


**A React app using:**
 - nodejs - as the server
 - react - for views
 - react-router-v4 - for routing
 - redux - for state managment
 - redux-thunk - for async data fetcing
 - react-intl - localization

# TODO:
-  Async routing
-  Routing transition
-  Modal route
-  Add localization
     -  server side Rendering
